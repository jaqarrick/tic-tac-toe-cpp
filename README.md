# Tic-tac-toe in C++

Simple implementation of 2 player tic tac toe in C++.

To use, clone this repo and make the `start.sh` command executable with `chmod`. For example: 

```
chmod u+x start.sh
```

Then you can run `./start.sh` from the folder's root directory. 

`start.sh` compiles the code with `g++` then executes its output `./a.out`.
